<p>　　Venerable Master, venerables, President of the Foundation, friends and colleagues,
<p>　　尊敬的老法師、諸位法師、基金會主席、朋友們、同事們：
<p>　　On behalf of the Vice-Chancellor and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, can I welcome you all to Lampeter and to say what an honour and pleasure it is to be able to host two days of ceremony and celebration. The ceremonies that we have today and tomorrow have come from London, and in two weeks they will go to Paris.
<p>　　我代表休斯校長和威爾士三一聖大衛大學歡迎大家齊聚蘭彼得。我們非常榮幸能夠在此地主辦為期兩天的祭祖大典和三時繫念法會。舉行這兩場活動的工作人員剛從倫敦來到蘭彼得，兩週後他們又要趕赴巴黎。
<p>　　You will all see that Lampeter, between London and Paris, is probably the smallest of those ceremonies, but it will be by far the friendliest of ceremonies. Today we have the Thrice Yearning Ceremony and then tomorrow the Ancestral Ceremony. Both ceremonies pay respect and honour to our ancestors and those departed. And this year we are especially mindful of our recently departed Provost of the Academy, Professor Clayton Chou.
<p>　　在大家看來，處於倫敦和巴黎之間的蘭彼得可能是規模最小的兩場活動，但是也是最友好的。我們今天舉辦三時繫念法會，明天再舉辦祭祖大典。這兩場活動都是為了祭奠我們的先祖和已故亡人。在今年的活動中我們尤其緬懷最近往生的漢學院院長周春塘教授。
<p>　　I think we are also doing something more over these two days. We also are giving honour to the shared vision and partnership established just two years ago between the Venerable Master and the Vice-Chancellor. A partnership that has sought to begin a journey of bringing the Master’s vision to the West, a partnership that has sought to educate new generations in ancient Chinese texts, wisdom and culture, and a partnership which is created the first academy of sinology dedicated to furthering the Master’s vision. So much has happened in those short two years.
<p>　　我想我們在這兩天中還有其他活動。我們還要紀念老法師和休斯校長兩年前所確立的共同願景以及合作關係。這一合作為的是開啟一條將老法師的願景帶到西方的旅程，這一合作為的是將中國古老的典籍、智慧及文化傳授給下一代，這一合作創立了第一所推動老法師願景的漢學院。在如此短暫的兩年內我們經歷了如此多的事情。
<p>　　This July our first cohort of MA students graduated. Our first cohort of Foundation Certificate students have graduated. This September we will take into the Lampeter the first cohort of BA Sinology students and we have launched the first ever programme across the world in professional doctorates in interfaith studies, whereby we have up to 15 top young scholars from all across the world, from all religions of the world, exploring the common basis of their faiths.
<p>　　今年七月我們的第一批碩士生畢業了，第一批獲得多元文化基金培訓證書的預科生畢業了。今年九月我們即將接收第一批漢學本科生來到蘭彼得學習。我們還建立了全球第一個和諧博士班，招收了十五名來自世界各地、信仰不同宗教的青年學者，共同探索宗教間的相通之處。
<p>　　In the future we look to launch with Master Chin Kung’s support bursaries dedicated to training young leaders for future projects and missionary work. And to all of this essential activity, we give honour and thanks to the vision and insight of the Venerable Master and Vice-Chancellor.
<p>　　我們希望在淨空老法師的支持下設立獎學金，為多元宗教項目以及傳教工作培養青年領袖。就所有這些重要活動而論，我們謹向老法師和校長的願景及洞察力致以崇高的敬意和感謝。
<p>　　So we have much to honour and to respect over the coming two days. Please make Lampeter your home for those two days. You are all very welcome here now and in the future. And genuinely we are friendly and kind lot. Can I finish by wishing everyone two wonderful days of ceremony.
<p>　　在未來的兩天裡，我們要向太多的人事物表達敬意。請大家在這兩天裡把蘭彼得當成自己的家。非常歡迎大家今天的到來，也歡迎大家以後再次造訪蘭彼得。說實在話，我們確實非常友善。最後，祝大家愉快的度過兩天殊勝的活動。　　</html>
