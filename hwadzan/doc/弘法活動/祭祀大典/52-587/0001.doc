<p>　　英國威爾士三一聖大衛大學 麥迪文．休斯校長：Good morning. Ni hao. Venerable Masters, Civic Leaders, Ladies and Gentlemen, I’m delighted to have the opportunity to join you once again this year here in London for the ancestors’ ceremony. May I at the beginning express my enormous gratitude to venerable Master Wudao and his colleagues for all enormous work that has been involved in preparing for this event. We live in a world where we need far more dialogue between traditions, between cultural traditions of the world. And this morning we have the opportunity of joining together in celebrating an ancient Chinese tradition, of celebrating and marking the importance of ancestors, of noting the importance of the past of tradition, and linking that tradition to a better world. You may ask what is the significance of the ceremony today. As we have heard already, it is about linking the tradition of the past and securing a better future for tomorrow. What we are doing today together, and there are so many different cultural traditions here in this auditorium, is joining together in celebrating the value of traditional Chinese culture, and celebrating the importance of the past, and noting the value of what we have learned from the past through the ancestors’ ceremony. This is an excellent example of intercultural dialogue of bringing together different traditions, different cultures, and identifying a common thread, a common thread of respect of tolerance, of working together for a better world. What we have learned through the teachings of Master Chin Kung is that education is at the heart of a civilised society. Although we are here from different traditions, we are one single humanity. Although there are different faith traditions here, different languages, different traditions of countries, that is a common thread of a single humanity working for common peace. And as we are living in a very troubled world, it is very important that we do remember the importance of filial piety, of respect, of tolerance, and working together. Our world, our future for tomorrow depends upon us working together, that we break those boundaries, that we identify the common threads. And hopefully, we seek a single union of peace and of harmony in the world. It is therefore a great pleasure for me to be part of this ceremony. To show respect to your tradition, to acknowledge the importance of the enormous culture that Chinese civilisation has given to the world and to bridge the traditions of the East and the West. And we work together for a better humanity and a single purpose of peace in our world. Thank you. Ddiolch.
<p>　　貝克斯利倫敦自治市市長London Borough of Bexley---Peter Lucia-Hennis：Now ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite the honourable Geraldene Lucia-Hennis, member of parliament, the mayor of London Borough of Bexley to come and say a few words for us. 
<p>　　Thank you very much. I feel like maybe I’m a little bit of fraud because I was invited here by a chance meeting. Now that chance meeting was at a citizenship for the London Borough of Bexley which I’m immensely proud to be mayor of for one year. From that meeting I got to be asked to attend here today to which I was very honoured to accept. I didn’t quite realise that I would have to address and speak to you. But for that, I’m eternally grateful. Then I started to wonder why I was invited. And I think now I know it wasn’t a fluke, it was by my divine intervene of the ancestors, if you like. Because in Bexley we have lots of culture which we’re very proud of. We’re very proud of our ancestors, too. But more so, maybe because I stand in front of you today as a mother, grandmother and a great-grand-mother. So I think I’m very qualified to say that I have been a very good teacher. But to get back to today, I’m not only honoured, I’m absolutely delighted to what I’ve just seen happen and I do wish you many successes in the years to come with this ceremony. Thank you for the invite.　　</html>
